# ðŸ—‚ Notes

- Formal engagement agreement and shared office space are currently highest priorities.
- Technical systems (AIMS, ISMS BoK) are progressing well; reviews pending.
- Team engagement via Notion/Obsidian, attire adjustments, and communication polishing will enhance external interfacing.
- Upcoming software billing and NAS/storage requirements need further scoping.
