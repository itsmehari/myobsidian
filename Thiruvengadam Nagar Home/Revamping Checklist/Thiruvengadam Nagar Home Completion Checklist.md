No painting work is done
tiles aredone 

i think we have to do patch fixing for walls

## Response:
Here‚Äôs a detailed **checklist and budget planning guide** to help you take over the incomplete home project and move it toward completion. Given the status, your priorities include **structural safety, waterproofing, finishing work, electrical and plumbing fitting, painting, and occupancy readiness.**

* * *

üè† PROJECT TAKEOVER CHECKLIST
-----------------------------

### üîç **A. SITE INSPECTION & STRUCTURAL REVIEW**

*    Structural stability check (especially due to 5 years idle)
    
*    Wall cracks / seepage / patch fixing needs
    
*    Waterproofing check (roof, bathrooms, external walls)
    
*    Pest infestation check (especially for idle buildings)
    
*    Check for rusting in grills, rods, balcony frames
    

**Recommended: Hire a civil engineer/architect to assess the building‚Äôs health.**

* * *

### ‚ö° **B. ELECTRICAL WORKS**

*    Switches, sockets, plug points
    
*    MCB board + surge protectors
    
*    Ceiling fan and light fittings
    
*    Inverter wiring support (if planned)
    
*    External wiring & safety inspection
    

**Budget tip**: Modular switch brands like Anchor, Havells, or GM can be selected based on aesthetic vs budget.

* * *

### üöø **C. PLUMBING & SANITARY FITTINGS**

*    Bathroom fixtures: commode, wash basin, shower, tap, geyser points
    
*    Kitchen sink & tap fittings

* * *

### üß± **D. CIVIL TOUCHUPS**

*    Patch fixing for broken/uneven walls

*    Waterproof putty / crack filler for minor repairs
    
*    Finalize grill/door lock reinforcements
    

* * *

### üé® **E. PAINTING & SURFACE FINISHING**

*    Pest control
    
*    CCTV / security provision
    
*    Final floor polish (if needed)
    

* * *

üí∞ BUDGET ESTIMATION BREAKDOWN
------------------------------

Here‚Äôs a ballpark estimate for finishing a home like yours (approx. 2000‚Äì2500 sq ft built-up):

| **Category** | **Estimated Cost (‚Çπ)** |
| --- | --- |
| Civil repairs & patching | ‚Çπ50,000 ‚Äì ‚Çπ1,00,000 |
| Electrical fittings | ‚Çπ80,000 ‚Äì ‚Çπ1,50,000 |
| Plumbing & sanitary | ‚Çπ70,000 ‚Äì ‚Çπ1,20,000 |
| Painting (internal + ext) | ‚Çπ1,50,000 ‚Äì ‚Çπ2,50,000 |
| Doors, handles, locks | ‚Çπ80,000 ‚Äì ‚Çπ1,50,000 |
| Misc (cleaning, pest etc.) | ‚Çπ30,000 ‚Äì ‚Çπ50,000 |
| **Total Estimate** | **‚Çπ4.5 ‚Äì ‚Çπ8 lakhs** |

> **Note**: Costs vary with material quality and labor rates. Modular fittings or branded sanitaryware will push it to the higher side.

* * *

‚úÖ NEXT STEPS SUGGESTED
----------------------

1.  **Hire an experienced local civil contractor or project manager** to:
    
    *   Assess scope in detail
        
    *   Bring electricians, plumbers, painters as needed
        
    *   Coordinate task timelines
        
2.  **Start with site cleaning + structural inspection** and get itemized quotations from vendors.
    
3.  Consider doing the work floor-wise if budget is constrained:
    
    *   Complete Ground Floor (1BHK) first for living or rental
        
    *   Then do 1st and 2nd floors in phases
        

* * *

Would you like:

*   A printable PDF version of this checklist?
    
*   An Excel sheet for budgeting?
    
*   Ready-to-send contractor inquiry template?
    

Let me know ‚Äî I can generate any or all of these for you.
